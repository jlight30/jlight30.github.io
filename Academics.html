        <h2>~ Academics ~</h2>
        <p> I am a third year undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am planning to graduate in the Spring of 2025. My major is Computational Media and my Minor is Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.
        </p>
        
        <p>I am currently employed by Georgia Tech as a Teaching Assistant for the lab period of "Introduction to Earth Processes." As a lab TA, I host labs where I give lectures on material, guide students through the lab, and answer questions.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite projects I've been involved with has been as a member of the Student Government, working on the Sustainability sector to tackle issues like waste during game days, student outreach, and holding meetings with other sustainabiloty focused groups on campus.
