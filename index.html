                    <p> Hello! and welcome to my website! My name is Jennifer Light and I am a third year undergraduate student at Georgia Tech majoring in Computational Media. This is a blended degree that combines computer science with the liberal arts, specificallly media, design, and communications.  </p>

                    <p> I just recently joined this major and am having a lot of fun learning about about computer science, websites, and design. I love creating art, especially portraits, and my favorite medium is oil paint. I am also in the process of learning how to use digital art resources like Photoshop and Adobe Animate. </p>

                    <p> I was an Earth and Atmospheric Sciences major for my first two years of college, but I eventually chose a different path. Being a part of that program did teach me a lot about our Earth and has grown my passion for sustainability.  </p>

                    <p> Outside of school, one of my favorite things to do in my free time is play volleyball. I joined the club volleyball team my second year at Georgia Tech and it has been one of the best decisions I have made since I got to college. I love how low-stress it is, and it's a great way to get all of my energy out at the end of the day. </p>
