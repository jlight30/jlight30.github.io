                    <p> Hello! and welcome to my website! My name is Jennifer Light and I am a third year undergraduate student at Georgia Tech majoring in Computational Media. This is a blended degree that combines computer science with the liberal arts, specificallly media, design, and communications.  </p>

                    <p> I just recently joined this major and am having a lot of fun learning about about computer science and design. I love creating art, especially portraits, and my favorite medium is oil paint. I am also trying to branch out into digital art and am learning how to use resources like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Animate. </p>

                    <p> For my first 2 years at Georgia Tech, I was an Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS) major, but I decided that path wasn't for me. Being a part of that program did teach me a lot about our Earth and has grown my passion for sustainability. I still love Earth science and am currently working as a TA for one of my favorite EAS labs courses that I took as a freshman. </p>

                    <p> Outside of school, one of my favorite things to do in my free time is play volleyball. I play on the club team and have also competed in intramurals every semester that I've been here. Maybe one of these years I'll actually make it to the finals. </p>
